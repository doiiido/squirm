2005-08-19: Fixed memory problem in lists.c (was freeing statically
            allocated structure).
            Thanks to Phil Kernick for patch.

	    Corrected erroneous email addresses and converted copyright
	    note to a single author plus contributors in CREDITS.

	    Removed cmalloc, cfree & cstrdup macros.

	    wrote safe_strdup() to return NULL for NULL argument. Replaced
	    all calls to strdup to safe_strdup.

            Code reformatting and other minor cosmetic chages (deleted
            old comment-out code and comments).

	    Changed log.c's log() to logprint() and replaced all calls
            to it.  Modern Linuxes have a log() function which causes compiler
	    warnings.

2005-08-21: Method strings were being incorrectly compared in config.c 
	    Thanks to Phil Kernick for patch.

2005-08-21: Fixed references to cfree() which was intended to be a
            macro that was removed in log.h
